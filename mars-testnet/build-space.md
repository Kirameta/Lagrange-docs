# Welcome to Task 2: Space Builder Challenge

This Task empowers participants to create and customize Spaces on the Lagrange Mars Testnet platform.

From August 1st to September 4th, 2023, participants will dive into the world of Space creation, forking a Space from our Base Space and running it successfully. 

As a participant in Task 2, you will have the opportunity to share the Prize Pool of 300,000 LAD. 

Additionally, Task 2 provides a platform for participants to showcase their creativity and attract more users. Sharing your forked Space on Twitter and YouTube will not only garner attention but also earn you an incentive.
